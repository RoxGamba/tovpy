# Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solver in Python

This repository provides a package that solves the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) equations for general-relativistic nonrotating equilibrium star configurations together with even/odd stationary perturbations of aribitrary multipolar index.

Notes:

- TOV equations are formulated following [Lindblom (1992)](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1992ApJ...398..569L)
- Perturbations equations and Love number computation follow [Damour and Nagar (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.80.084035)
- The code supports EOS in piecewise polytropic and tabular form
